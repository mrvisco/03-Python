Update 6/16/19 - Added the final piece to this homework assignment

I initially had trouble completing this assignment and ended up submitting the work late.  The work submitted late was not complete but was in the best shape at
the time.  Since this was already late, I had to put this assignment on the side so I could work on the Pandas homework.  I didn't want two assignments being
submitted late.  I wanted to submit both the PyBank and PyPoll at the same time but I want to at least get the PyBank submitted and will submit the PyPoll by the 
end of day 6/14/19.
